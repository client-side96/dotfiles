#+title: Dotfiles documentation

** Installation

The installation of the dotfiles can be started automatically by executing the ~.install-dotfiles.sh~ script.
The script first tries to install the packages defined in the ~packages~ array via the package manager of the host system.

*NOTE*: Some packages might not be available on every package manager. This script was tested on Fedora.
